      Current Software Engineering student at Canterbury Christ Church University 
      with a strong interest in computing and old cars. My spare time is usually 
      spent either working on cars, researching something about cars, experimenting
      with computers (software and hardware) or learning about a variety of topics 
      through YouTube videos. I am a quick learner and am adaptable to different 
      scenarios or roles.
